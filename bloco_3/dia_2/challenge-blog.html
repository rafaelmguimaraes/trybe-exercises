        <p class="paragr">Average computer users would be forgiven for not having any idea what PGP is. There is so much going on below the surface of the modern computing experience that even critically important security tools like PGP are tucked away. <br><br>

To be sure, there are specialized circles that make regular explicit use of PGP. Diligent Linux users would have at least a passing familiarity with PGP, since the fact that manufacturers didn't install our OS for us means we have to verify its integrity ourselves.<br><br>

Otherwise, if your work doesn't touch on information security, PGP would understandably be a mystery to you. But like I said, it is no less important for this reality. In fact, PGP played a significant part in why we have secure communications on the Internet. This actually isn't because it's widely used, although it definitely is utilized in software installation utilities the world over. Rather, its significance stems from its defiant challenge to an overzealous government that sought to compromise encryption long before most Americans used the Internet regularly.</p>

        <p class="paragr">IBM is chasing two of the three technology areas that I think will change the world as we know it over the next two decades. Granted, we are currently experiencing a level of unprecedented change, thanks to the pandemic, and it is dramatically accelerating at least one of these efforts.<br><br>

The three technology changes that I'm watching are robotics (including things like autonomous cars), AI computing, and quantum computing.<br><br>

IBM's focus has been on the AI (Watson), and quantum computing efforts. I got an update on their AI efforts last week, and they have moved the ball a lot over the last few months.<br><br>

Let's talk about that this week, and we'll close with my product of the week -- a new powerful router from Linksys that could be a godsend for those of us with a ton of connected devices.</p>

        <p class="paragr">Some years ago, Marc Benioff told me he was not interested in developing back office apps that would compete with SAP and Oracle in the ERP and finance market. Many people, myself included, looked askance at that idea and wondered out loud how the company would continue to grow because, hey, there's front office and back office and nothing else right?<br><br>

Nope.<br><br>

Salesforce decided to do the hard thing, to invent a new category of apps that support an organization's enhanced role in the community and the marketplace. So far, just to review, it has developed the Philanthropy Cloud, the Nonprofit Cloud, the Education Cloud, and a rash of custom CRM for vertical industries like healthcare and finance. It even just completed acquisition of Vlocity, a company that leverages Salesforce Lightning to build and deploy custom vertical apps.<br><br>

In all of this the company made the original CRM product both a demonstration project for what can be and, to one way of viewing it, continues to commoditize CRM. But if this is commoditization, it's happening without the price cutting and margin erosion you expect when too many people already have hoola-hoops.</p>
