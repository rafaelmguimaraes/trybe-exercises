# Trybe Exercises

This repository contains all learning activities developed by *me* while studying at *Trybe* :rocket:

In each block, we are encouraged to develop projects based on the concept learned, and the contents of these projects are in another repository called *[Trybe-Projects]()*.

The program has more than **1,500 hours** of classroom and online classes and covers front-end, back-end, computer science, software engineering, agile methodologies, and soft skills.

I started the course at **August 10, 2020** (class 07).

Expected end date: **August 10, 2021** (1 year).
